https://www.instagram.com/p/CG6SGX8rj7R/,"Our take-home tub prices are increasing.. but before you yell at us, please have a read of our very reasonable reasoning as to why they are...Weve traditionally always priced our take home tubs to be cheap. Very deliberately. In fact, cheaper than just about all of our competitors (even the crap ones ).At the same time we have always strived to produce the best quality gelato you can buy, made from the best ingredients we can source.We produce our own jersey milk, we refine our own chocolate, we farm our own strawberries/hazelnuts and weve also started using recyclable styrofoam tubs which arent cheap. We ACTUALLY make everything from scratch. We dont just talk about it, we live it.We also are in the middle of a global pandemic which has resulted in a shift away from our in-store products (scoops) to more take home products (tubs and cakes). Makes sense of course.. we were in lockdown for most of the year. But with this change in the mix of products comes a bunch of unexpected cost implications including much higher packaging expenses, delivery commissions, lower margins, etc.Taking all of this into account we decided that we needed to increase the prices of our tubs ever so slightly. It's not much (about 5% increase), and we think it's pretty fair considering the current economic climate. We hope you agree The new prices are:500ml - $15.501L - $26.001.5L - $30.50Even at our new prices, weve noticed we are still cheaper than just about every other gelato store out there.. sounds like a good deal to us!Edited  107w","OCTOBER 29, 2020"

https://www.instagram.com/p/B_G2IXfjupA/,"APOLOGIES IF YOU GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE COOKIE PIE CHAOS!Last night the Cookie Pie thing went completely nutso. Not only was demand through the roof but things escalated extremely quickly. We know things didnt go perfectly for everyone and it was probably a bit frustrating trying to order at times and for this we apologise. But the truth is its not easy to predict demand or get the logistics right during a global pandemic.The orders came in so quickly that we just had to turn delivery off at times or orders simply wouldnt get fulfilled. We know this was frustrating but we just had to do it. We had swarms of Deliveroo drivers descending on stores and we just had to clear the deck at times. We count ourselves very lucky that we are one of the few hospitality businesses that remains open during the lock down, but weve had to make huge adjustments to staffing and working stock levels as our usual in-store turnover has fallen off a cliff.Its a bit of a tightrope at the moment. At times we are understaffed, out of stock, and just generally unprepared for unexpected demand! It was straight up chaos at times last night. But thats the unfortunate reality of trying to stay in business at the moment.The good news is we specifically set aside more stock which is available for today (available from 1pm in most stores on DELIVEROO ONLY STILL THIS TIME). We are also already working on the next bake at home cookie pie and ways in which we can ensure things are less hectic when we release the next round. So, stick with us and stand by.. The next one is killer.If you have any comments or messages (good or bad), please just DM us or send an email. Weve already had heaps of great feedback and seems everyone that got the pie, loved the hot gooey goodness!Of course weve had a few potty mouthed complaints this morning as well but on the whole everyone was pretty understanding so thank you!Edited  134w","APRIL 18, 2020"

However some new rules and regulations will apply and we ask that everyone abides by these to ensure the safety of our staff and customers. - PLEASE PRACTICE SENSIBLE SOCIAL DISTANCING IN STORE. We are currently only serving 2-3 customers at any one time (depending on the size of the store) to maintain appropriate social distancing. Please only enter store once staff members become available for service.- We are now strictly takeaway only - In-store seating is no longer available (please make your purchase and move outside).- We are no longer offering samples/taste testers for obvious reasons.- Napkins are no longer available on front counter - please ask staff should you require and they will provide.If we follow some simple rules, we will potentially remain open, our staff stay employed and our customers keep getting yummy gelato - win win win!Just a friendly reminder: - 99% of our products are produced from raw materials in our highly regulated factory in Rosebery. Even before COVID-19 was a thing, our compliance requirements are such that we maintain extremely high levels of hygiene and cleanliness. To be safe, weve reviewed these and already stepped them up to the next level where required.- All of our stores have also implemented extra hygiene and sanitisation practices, and have implemented ways to ensure that customer service is almost entirely contactless. Please avoid cash payments if possible. Pay by the Messina App and you dont even need to tap your card! As of today, we've doubled the amount of loyalty points you'll receive as a small thank you for supporting us.- Stores are still open, and we encourage you to come get your fix.

BUT we have recently introduced 3 big changes to minimise our environmental impact while we work towards it.1. You can now bring back your (clean) Styrofoam Messina tubs to stores for recycling. Just eat your gelato, wash the tub and return it your local store on your next visit. The clean containers returned to us are 100% recycled, crushed and reused in other polystyrene products reducing the amount of new polystyrene that needs to be made.2. Were now working with Simply Cups to recycle all of our cups. In every Messina store youll find two Simply Cups tubes. Once youve finished your gelato you can put your empty cups inside for them to be recycled.3. All stores now have dedicated recycling and waste bins. When you're eating in store take of note of the helpful signs on the bin and make sure you're putting your rubbish in the right one.You can read more at the link in our bio.Edited  144w","FEBRUARY 12, 2020"

You can now bring back your (clean) Styrofoam tubs to stores for recycling. Just eat your gelato, wash the tub and return it your local store on your next visit. The clean containers returned to us are 100% recycled, crushed and reused in other styrofoam products.2. Were now working with Simply Cups to recycle all of our cups. In every Messina store youll find two Simply Cups tubes. Once youve finished your gelato you can put your empty cups inside for them to be recycled.You may ask why dont you just introduce reusable cups and tubs? as it seems like the simple solution. However, due to rules and regulations regarding health and safety (plus a handful of other issues) its proven extremely difficult to implement..

About 10 years ago, a change in Australian law meant we couldnt import real dulce de leche from Argentina anymore. It hurt to hear, but there was no way around it.So we went on making dulce de leche gelato the best we could. We tried every tick we had up our sleeve but nothing quite cut it. It just wasnt right.So we bit the bullet, canned it from the cabinet, and decided to take on the huge task of learning how to make it ourselves... properly.After a trip to Argentina, a big investment in some fancy equipment, lots of testing and many lessons from Argentinian experts,we are finally satisfied that we are now producing the real deal. Yep, this is as authentic as you can get in Australia and we can guarantee it.Really a true dulce de leche is simple  you just need good quality milk, a little sugar and a few secrets. It is then slowly simmered until all moisture is removed from the milk. (not a can of condensed milk in sight ) So come let us know what you think.We promise itll be better than ever!Read the full post at the link our bio!Edited  240w","APRIL 13, 2018"

So we were double chuffed when the Kings & Queens of biscuits asked us to come back so we could launch THREE more flavours with them this yearPresenting: Turkish Delight, Choc Cherry Coconut and Iced Coffee.We dug back into our flavour archive for the new flavours  some of you may remember Messina Specials such as Persian Rocky Road (cue inspo for Turkish Delight), 1985 (now a Choc Cherry Coconut Tim Tam) or our Coffee gelato, a classic flavour in the cabinet. We tinkered and tailored the flavours with the experts at Tim Tam to turn them into the new biscuits, and theyre down right delicious if we do say so ourselves. And seeing as we do like a chilled treat, try keeping them in the fridge and eating them cold. Theyve got snazzy packaging which changes colour in the fridge too. Weve debated this subject many times in the office  fridge, cupboard, fridge, freezer(?) or desk side drawerthe choice is yours, just get them in your gob.The range is available at all good supermarkets near you from NOW.You can read more about all the flavours weve made at gelatomessina.com/timtam250w","JANUARY 29, 2018"

Sure, but we think everyone should have the right to make their own decisions. Its not rocket science is it... It's about time Australia joined the 30 countries that have already legitimised marriage equality and lets stop talking about it!You can visit any Messina store this weekend and ask them for a paper form to register for your vote or update your details. Fill it out, hand it back to a staff member and we'll make sure we post it for you on Monday. That in itself is a pretty old school way to do it, so you can fill out the form online right here right now > http://www.aec.gov.au/enrol/PRINTED FORMS WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ALL MESSINA STORES UNTIL CLOSE ON SUNDAY 20TH AUGUST.

@gelatomessina Dear Messina, question, are you planning on opening a store on the lower north shore?? (maybe in Crows nest or Neutral bay - hint!) it would be much appreciated by those living across the bridge! 🙋🏽❤️🍦Serious Messina cravings also exist here. (says someone who just drove to three Messinas to find some of this liquid gold)

In most part the support was amazing (thanks) and most people resonated with our attempt to highlight the absurdity of these lockout laws, using an even more absurd example of where things could end up! No gelato after 7pm!! We were in no way mocking or poking fun at businesses that have been destroyed by these ridiculous laws. In fact, quite the contrary. We were, however definitely poking fun at the NSW Government for treating us like children.Not everyone agreed that it was the right tact, and there was certainly some healthy discussion in our threads (some of it was a little bit aggressive which we werent terribly happy about, but at least there was healthy debate).We accept that there are differing views on how our collective opposition to these laws should be handled, but ironically much of the negative feedback came from those who shared our view that lock out laws are not the solution to so called 'alcohol fuelled violence. The debate is not necessarily a bad thing, as it simply means people are passionate about the issue.Whether you agreed or not, our end game was to highlight the fact that we feel these laws are a mistake and impose restrictions on personal freedom and personal choice. It nullifies the concept of personal responsibility and simple respect for a diverse community. The effect has been to simply decrease cultural diversity and vibrancy in a city that really should be a proud, international city of the world. One that we can all be proud of. The current situation is a bit sad in our eyes... So, today is the day. The last day that you can have your say and make a submission to the Independent Review of the impact of Liquor Law reform. You can find all the details here:http://www.liquorlawreview.justice.nsw.gov.au/If you feel strongly about the Lock Out laws, whether you are a business, an individual... whether you sell alcohol or you dont, its important to have your say.What we do know is our great city has been drastically affected by the laws.

If wed asked you 2 years ago if Kings Cross and Darlinghurst would be a ghost town at 2am on a Saturday night, youd probably have laughed at us as well.Unfortunately, that part is true, and we think it's sad. We loved the vibrancy, the diversity and the craziness that was The Cross!As a business that has nothing to do with alcohol fuelled violence (unless you really go to town on poached figs and marsala), we too have inadvertently felt the effects of these reactionary, archaic, and politicised lock out laws.Were not complaining.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BDoqfnXLX4D/,"Due to circumstances beyond our control, and for reasons associated with recent changes in the NSW State Government 'Lock Out Laws, we regret to inform customers that our Darlinghurst and Surry Hills stores are now unable to trade past 7pm.The current lock-out laws imposed on Sydney's licensed venues has resulted in a marked increase in foot traffic at both our Darlinghurst and Surry Hills stores, as consumers seek alternative late night entertainment venues outside of clubs/pubs.An unforeseen consequence of this has been an increase in what police have described as 'frequent antisocial behaviour and overly loud, repetitive music in close proximity to Messina stores. This increased foot traffic, combined with our existing store queues has made the situation untenable and we have been threatened with fines and potential legal action by council. We have attempted to engage in meaningful discussion with council, licensing police and all relevant stake holders but have failed to find common ground. As such, we are being forced to comply with new trading restrictions until further notice.The trading hours for these stores will now be 11am - 7pm daily. Any delivery services will now also cease at this time. *All other stores will continue to operate as normal, with The Star store being granted an exemption for late night trading inline with existing casino hours (what do you know?!) ** Melbourne stores are not affectedWe will continue to fight these ludicrous restrictions and fight these laws which are killing the soul of our city and bring back our normal trading hours as soon as we can.
