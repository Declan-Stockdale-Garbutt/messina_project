# Messina Project

## Overview
The goal of this project ws to scrape all submissions by the gelatomessina instagram channel. This was done to determine the most common flavours/ingredients over time. Only the text on the post was recorded

## Current progress

### Scrape the page
Various limitations were discovered when trying to scrape the instagram channel leading to hacky work arounds. It was achieved using a selenium browser and pyautogui to click on the image and save the images along with post by the channel. Replies were not kept.


## Work in progress
- Change date on posts that include x days ago to a proper date
- Clean text
- EDA on text data
- Create visuals
